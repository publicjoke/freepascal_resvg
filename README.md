# freepascal_resvg

Here is the Free Pascal (https://www.freepascal.org) wrapper for the resvg library (https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg) along with the test
Lazarus (https://www.lazarus-ide.org) project. resvg.dll presented here is 64-bit but of course you can build your own instance of it from sources (it's written in Rust).
